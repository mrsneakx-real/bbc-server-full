# Set condition(s) that should return true to display this profile.
# This allows you to create profiles to only show for specific scenarios (i.e. player is banned).
#
# 'AND'/'&&' and 'OR'/'||' can be used to chain together multiple conditions.
#
# Removing the condition option or setting it to an empty String will be treated as a true condition being returned.

#
# Set one or multiple profiles.
#
# A profile can contain the same options as used in the file itself, except for priority and condition.
# If multiple entries are present, a random one will be selected. Any options set in the selected profile will override
# any existing option in the file.
#
# Example: The below profile configuration will randomly change the MOTD between two types, but keep the Hover text
#          the same.
#
# When not present or empty (profiles: []), no profiles will be used and global options from the file will be used instead.

#
# Set the "Message of the day" to display.
# This option supports RGB colors for 1.16+ Servers and clients. More advanced MiniMessage features such as <gradient>
# can be used for further styling the text.
#
# <center> can be put at the start of a line to have AdvancedServerList automatically center the text as good as
# possible.
#
# Only the first two lines will be considered and any additional one is ignored.
#
# When not present or empty (motd: []), no MOTD will be set.

motd:

#
# Set the Favicon (image on the left of a server entry) to display.
# This option supports three types of input:
#
#   1. Filename, including the .png extension, matching a filename in the favicons folder of the plugin.
#      - 'random' can be used to have AdvancedServerList select a random image from the favicons folder every time
#        the server is pinged.
#   3. URL pointing to an image.
#   4. Player name, UUID or a placeholder that returns either.
#      - https://mc-heads.net will be used to retrieve an image of the provided name/UUID.
#
# Any image below or above 64x64 pixels will be resized according to the faviconResizeMode option in the config.yml.
#
# If not present or empty (favicon: ''), defaults to not modifying the favicon.

#
# "The favicon isn't showing!"
#   This is a side effect of using either URLs or player names/UUIDs for the favicon.
#   These types require AdvancedServerList to create a new favicon object from scratch. This action takes a significant
#   amount of time, which can cause the server to show with a huge ping.
#   To avoid this is this action performed asynchronously. This means that the plugin doesn't wait for the favicon to
#   be created before continuing, which can result in no favicon being available when it is done handling the ping.
#   This should only happen for the first ping of a player and subsequent pings should display the favicon, if the
#   pings are done within the configured cache time (See 'faviconCacheTime' in the config.yml).
